Subject: use case on loan approval or denial status using decision tree and random forest algorithm <br>
<br>
Respected everyone, <br>
<br>
The aim of this case study is to predict the loan approval or denial status of an applicant using decision tree and random forest 
algorithm. First we load the dataset and the libraries into the code. We then carry out data exploration activities like taking a 
peek at the data, studying descriptive statistics, class distributions and correlation between attributes. We further explore the 
data and then carry out data visualization using univariate (histogram, density and box and whisker) plots and multivariate 
(scatter plot matrix and correlation matrix) plots. We then split the data into train and test data and then instantiate a decision 
tree classifier and random forest classifier. Then the model is fitted and the acuracy is found out. We predict the values and plot 
the confusion matrix. Decision tree and random forest classifiers give an accuarcy of 80 and 83 % respectively.
